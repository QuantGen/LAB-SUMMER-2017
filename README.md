# Neural Networks with TensorFlow in Python

[Group's Website](http://quantgen.github.io/)

As a summer activity in our lab, we have prepared a small internal workshop to share experiences and speed up our learning with Tensorflow which is an open source software for machine learning capable of building and training neural networks to detect and decipher patterns and correlations.

* **Date**: Friday, May 26, 2017 from 9:30 am to 12:30 pm.
* **Location**: Phillips 149 (Mason Seminar Room), 361 Physics Rd, East Lansing, MI 48825
* **Material needed**: Bring your laptop. The software will be installed in your own laptop and it will be run either in the HPCC or in your laptop.
